# aws-delete-orphaned-cloudwatch-logs
Deletes CloudWatch log groups that were generated by Lambda functions that no longer exist

Developing Lambda functions that create CloudWatch logs can create an accumulation of CloudWatch log groups. Deleting a Lambda function does not delete its corresponding CloudWatch log group (nor would you necessarily want it to), so these can build over time.

This function cross-references the log groups and determines which ones are orphaned. In view-only mode, the function will return the list of orphaned log groups; in non-view-only mode, it will delete them. You are strongly encouraged to use view-only mode first.

The function will need the following permissions:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:DeleteLogGroup",
                "logs:DescribeLogGroups"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

To use view-only mode, pass in the parameter: 

```
{ "view_only" : "true" }
```
